# Hey there! 👋 I'm Gargi

I'm a developer who's been in the game for a bit now. I graduated with a Bachelor's in Technology, and since then, I've been:

- Building **web apps** 🖥️
- Cranking out **APIs** 🔗
- Battling some wild **layout bugs** 🐞


## Languages:
- **English** (Business level fluent)
- **Japanese** (ビジネスレベルで日本語もペラペラです！)
- **Hindi** , **Tamil**

## Tech stack:
I am a BTech graduate, so I have at least touched a lot of languages and actually worked with quite a bit of them too. 
(Include Assembly language, that thing got me working late nights)
however, here's the tech stack I am working with at the job I do right now:
- **Frontend**: `React`, `JavaScript`
- **Backend**: `Flask`, `Python`, `Node.js`
- **AI**: `Azure AI Suite`, `RAG System`
