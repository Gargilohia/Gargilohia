# Hey there! 👋 I'm Gargi

I'm a developer who's been in the game for a bit now. I graduated with a Bachelor's in Technology, and since then, I've been:

- Building **web apps** 🖥️
- Cranking out **APIs** 🔗
- Battling some wild **layout bugs** 🐞

Lately, I've been diving head-first into the world of **AI** (yes, the fancy stuff). Specifically, I've worked with **Generative AI** and meddled with **Azure's AI development suite**. I even built a **RAG system** at work! If you want the juicy details, you will have to catch me when I am in my best mood 🍰.

## What I bring to the table:
- Endured more than **8-hour workdays** at a desk job ⌨️
- Survived endless meetings and precisely documented every task 📄
- Logged my work by the hour (true story) 🕒
- Genuinely in it for the learning (but the paycheck doesn't hurt 💰)

## Languages:
- **English** (Business level fluent)
- **Japanese** (ビジネスレベルで日本語もペラペラです！)

## Tech stack:
I am a BTech graduate, so I have at least touched a lot of languages and actually worked with quite a bit of them too. 
(Include Assembly language, that thing got me working late nights)
however, here's the tech stack I am working with at the job I do right now:
- **Frontend**: `React`, `JavaScript`
- **Backend**: `Flask`, `Python`, `Node.js`
- **AI**: `Azure AI Suite`, `RAG System`
- 🛠️ Other Tools I like using

- I enjoy cooking and working out in my free time.
